# Evolutionary-Algorithm-Simulation
The goal of this project was to provide a realistic physics simulator that could determine a pre-designed creature's optimal walk cycle (that is, its fastest and most efficient possible combination of limb motions). In order to achieve this, the program iterates through a number of generations inputted by the user, randomly "mating" and "mutating" creatures, and filtering out the ones whose walk cycles yield relatively small net displacements. Finally, the program runs the simulation of the first randomly generated creature on the top half of the screen in parallel with the most "ideal" creature in the final generation on the bottom half of the screen.
